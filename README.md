# Psyliq-HR-data-analysis-Project
In this project aimed at enhancing PSYLIQ's hiring strategies, a data-driven approach is adopted. The process begins with an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, where essential hiring data is extracted from PSYLIQ's records, including job roles, salary changes, and employment outcomes. During the transformation phase, the data undergoes standardization and error correction using Power Query in Excel. The subsequent analysis in Power BI focuses on obtaining deep insights through advanced features, examining variables such as departmental performance, marital status, and salary hikes using complex calculations with DAX. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide PSYLIQ's Hiring Department with actionable insights to optimize recruitment processes and effectively attract top talent
